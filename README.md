### 🧱 Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Google Fonts – *Outfit*

### 💡 What I Learned

- How to center content perfectly using Flexbox.
- Creating clean UI components with rounded corners and box shadows.
- Using `@media` queries to handle small screen sizes.
- Font pairing and color scheme alignment with design systems.

#### Example Snippet:

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
}
.card {
  background-color: white;
  border-radius: 25px;
  box-shadow: 1px 2px 5px hsl(216, 15%, 48%);
}
```

### 🔄 Continued Development

- Practice using CSS Grid for layout as an alternative to Flexbox.
- Add dark mode toggle feature for better accessibility.
- Work on making components modular and reusable in future projects.
